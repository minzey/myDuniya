An Android application which aggregates not only syndicated web content such as online newspapers, blogs and video blogs (vlogs), but also twitter feeds, to serve as a one stop solution to burdened surfing over different sites. The application displays personalised data by assessing the user's Facebook and Twitter habits and continuously refines the displayed content by learning his habits on the application.
